Robots capable of juggling are designed and built both to increase and test understanding and theories of human movement, juggling, and robotics. Juggling robots may include sensors to guide arm/hand movement or may rely on physical methods such as tracks or funnels to guide prop movement. Since true juggling requires more props than hands, many robots described as capable of juggling are not.",

    "description": "Robot welding is the use of mechanized programmable tools (robots), which completely automate a welding process by both performing the weld and handling the part.  Processes such as gas metal arc welding, while often automated, are not necessarily equivalent to robot welding, since a human operator sometimes prepares the materials to be welded.  Robot welding is commonly used for resistance spot welding and arc welding in high production applications, such as the automotive industry.",

Robots capable of juggling are designed and built both to increase and test understanding and theories of human movement, juggling, and robotics. Juggling robots may include sensors to guide arm/hand movement or may rely on physical methods such as tracks or funnels to guide prop movement. Since true juggling requires more props than hands, many robots described as capable of juggling are not.",

Processes such as gas metal arc welding, while often automated, are not necessarily equivalent to robot welding, since a human operator sometimes prepares the materials to be welded.  Robot welding is commonly used for resistance spot welding and arc welding in high production applications, such as the automotive industry.",

The embodiment of the robot, situated in a physical embedding, provides at the same time specific difficulties (e.g. high-dimensionality, real time constraints for collecting data and learning) and opportunities for guiding the learning process (e.g. sensorimotor synergies, motor primitives...",

In response to international condemnation of such abuses, the nations of Qatar and the UAE have banned the use of human jockeys in favor of robot...",

Articulated robots can range from simple 6 Degree of Freedom structures to systems with 10 or more interacting joints and materials.\nThey are powered by a variety of means, including electric motors.",

Among other advantages, this mechanical arrangement simplifies the robot control arm solution. It has high reliability and precision when operating in three-dimensional space.[2] As a robot ...",

Robot welding is commonly used for resistance spot welding and arc welding in high production applications, such as the automotive industry.",

This is one of the most commonly used robots in industry today (many examples can be found from legged robots or industrial robots).  Articulated robots can range from simple 6 Degree of Freedom structures to systems with 10 or more interacting joints and materials.\nThey are powered by a variety of means, including electric motors.",

Among other advantages, this mechanical arrangement simplifies the robot control arm solution. It has high reliability and precision when operating in three-dimensional space.[2] As a robot ...",
